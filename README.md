# Form-I
A simple create account/profile form, never did one for real.
This one is pretty simple, wanted to use the camera features more than anything, not even using Validity Object here.
Also, the input data treatment was mostly done in the front-end, including with element properties within HTML (length and patterns).

Soon, my intention is to make a second form, more polite and using the back-end for validation as well.
